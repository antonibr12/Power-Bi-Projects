 Power BI Dashboard | Amazon Prime Movies and TV Shows
 In this project I used the Original dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/amazon-prime-movies-and-tv-shows/
 I did not need to clean the data or remove any values since the data was alredy organized and cleaned.
 I spent the majority of the time creating the vizualizations one by one and responding the specific questions.

 Questions.

 What is the total number of ratings?                   
 What are the total number of shows by Country?          
 What is the percentage of Movies and for Tv Shows?
 What is the total number of titles in Prime Video?
 What are the Total ratings?
 What are the total genres?
 What is the total number of directors?
 What is the oldest title in Prime Video?
 What is the most recent title in Prime Video?

 Conclusions.
 There are a total of 9655 titles in Prime Video. Another interesting fact is that the total number of movies is higher than tv shows in Prime Video, we can see this in the dashbaord, back in 2000s the number of movies in prime was already higher than tv shows. Accounting for more than 1000 movies and tv shows with only less than 500.
